# 120 Years of Olympics

### Data

The Olympics RDF data that is created in the article:

[Creating Linked Data](https://medium.com/@addlesee/creating-linked-data-31c7dd479a9e)

can be found zipped in the data directory. Each zip contains the same knowledge graph but in different formats corresponding to their titles.

I have removed duplicate triples from the `.nt` and `.ttl` files, hence "nodup" in zip title.

### Queries

The queries that were created to query the above data in the article:

[Constructing SPARQL Queries](https://medium.com/wallscope/constructing-sparql-queries-ca63b8b9ac02)

can be found in the queries directory.
